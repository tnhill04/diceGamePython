	This is my random dice game. When you start the program, player one enters their name clicks enter on the keyboard
	It shows player one's six random dice roll. Then it asks for player two's name. Enter player two's name and click
	enter. Next it shows player two's six random dice roll. Finally it shows each players dice roll's added togther and
	tells the players who won.
