	This is my random dice game. 
	
	
	**Steps to run my python file**

    **ONE WAY**
	
		- Go to python.org and download python 3.9 (it is free)
		
		- Once downloaded, download and place the dice.py in and easy to access place on your computer.
            (I would suggest putting the file one the desktop)

		- Open your command prompt or terminal. 
		
		- Input the path to the folder where you downloaded the dice.py to. 
            (An example would be to enter in "cd desktop") This will point you to desktop
		
		- Next type in "python dice.py" click enter


    **ANOTHER WAY**

        - git clone https://github.com/tnhill04/diceGamePython.git
        - cd diceGamePython
        - python dice.py
		
	
	**Steps on how the file works**
	
		**Step one**
		When you run the program, player one enters their name clicks enter on the keyboard
		It shows player one's six random dice roll. 
		
		**Step two**
		Then it asks for player two's name. Enter player two's name and click
		enter. Next it shows player two's six random dice roll.
		
		**Step three**
		Finally it shows each players dice roll's added togther and
		tells the players who won. 
		
		**Bonus**
		
		It tells you how many days til Easter and Happy Coding!
		
		
		I use built-in Python functions. I imported random and datetime. I used python 3.9 
		
		**Features**
		
		- Created a dictionary and list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, 
		and use it in your program
		
		- I made more than 3 functions and called on two of them.
		
		- Calculated and displayed data based on an external factor. 
		Got the current date, and display how many days remaining until Easter)
